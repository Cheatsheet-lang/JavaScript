## Main

## Print

One of the basic functions which we need to know is the print of the language, which helps us in many ways to debug the code and to know the output of the code.

```javascript
console.log("Hello World");
```

## Variables

Like any other programming language, JS also has variables, by the variables in JS we can store any type of data in it, and we can use it later in the code. These are loosely typed variables, which means that you don't have to specify the data type of the variable.

```javascript
const integer = 10; // Integer variable
const string = "Hello World"; // String variable
const float = 10.5; // Float variable
const boolean = true; // Boolean variable
```
